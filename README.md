# AetherAI
AI models made from first principle. No libraries. No external modules.\
I plan on working on more models other than the LSTMNN. But the LSTM seemed like a good place to start. Backproprogation through time hasnt been implemented yet. This is because the LSTM featured in AevisTemp.py module has slight changes to it. So all pre-derived formulas no longer apply.
